This error occurs when you try to access (render) a value in the View using a Vue app template
when that value has not been computed or defined in some way in the model. It is not something to
be ignored. For instance, if you add a computed value variable to the View and haven't yet 
put in the computed method into the model, it will give you this error because the variable will have no value.
To fix it you must define the variable value within the model, either by creating the computed field or by setting
its value somewhere else within the model.
